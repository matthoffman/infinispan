/**
 * TODO: change this to an interface, and let the main implementor extend RecursiveTask? Then we'd
 * need to have a wrapper, though, right? Class indicating that this particular RecursiveTask can be
 * distributed.
 * 
 * In essence, saying a task can be distributed is effectively saying
 * "this task is coarse-grained enough that it's worth sending to another machine." If a task is
 * very small, it is often not worth sending off to another server to process; the communication
 * overhead is too high.
 * 
 * Obviously, there's cases where that's not true. For example, if we had a ton of very fine-grained
 * tasks, it would still be worth it to distribute some of those tasks; the overhead in distribution
 * may well be less than the amount of time it would take one machine to execute all tasks. And it
 * could be possible to detect those situations and automatically distribute tasks accordingly: we
 * can estimate our queue length, for example. But instead we are relying on developers to design
 * their tasks such that they are broken down from larger parts into smaller, and furthermore that
 * they mark those larger tasks as "distributable" for us. Further optimization is TBD.
 * 
 * <h2>Deciding whether to use DistributableTask or LocalTask</h2>
 * 
 * Sometimes the decision for when to make a task a DistributableTask vs. a LocalTask is fairly
 * clear. Sometimes it isn't. As a general heuristic, consider the amount of time it would take to
 * serialize a task, send it to another server, and deserialize it. Then add to that the time it
 * would take to serialize the result, send that back to the this server, and deserialize it.
 * 
 * 
 * There are tradeoffs involved in deciding between DistributableTask and LocalTask. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Obviously, if you use LocalTask, the task cannot be distributed, even if the current server is
 * very backed up.</li>
 * <li>
 * If you use DistributedTask, but the task is very small, it could be that the time it takes to
 * transfer the task to another server and then transfer the results back is higher than the time it
 * would have taken to execute the task locally. Note that you can attempt to crudely predict this
 * case algorithmically, if you really want, by estimating the queue size of the current node, and
 * then using an educated guess for the execution time of those tasks. This is, at best, a very
 * rough heuristic, and dependent on an accurate knowledge of what is currently running.</li>
 * <li>
 * Because the "distribution" portion of the ForkJoin framework is bolted on, making something a
 * DistributableTask introduces some overhead even if the task is only distributed locally. This
 * should be on the order of milliseconds, at most, but that could be significant if the tasks are
 * large.</li>
 * </ul>
 * add some overhead.
 * 
 * If you are algorithmically deciding whether a task should be a DistributableTask or a LocalTask,
 * consider making it a DistributableTask just in case.
 * 
 * If in doubt, you could do something like the following from within your task, but <b>please
 * note</b> that we have not yet verified that this is actually worth it. Want to be the first and
 * run some tests?
 * 
 * <code>
            if (ForkJoinTask.inForkJoinPool()) {
                 if (ForkJoinTask.getSurplusQueuedTaskCount() > 3) {
                     // create a DistributableTask
                 } else {
                     // create a LocalTask
                 }
             } else {
                 // we're not within a currently executing ForkJoinTask, so we can't check surplus queued task count.
                 // create a DistributableTask, just in case.
             }

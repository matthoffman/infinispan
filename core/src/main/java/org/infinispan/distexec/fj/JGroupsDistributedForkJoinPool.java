/**
 * This is heavily inspired by Bela Ban's paper on Task Distribution in JGroups (http://www.jgroups.org/taskdistribution.html)
 * and the discussion on the infinispan-dev list here:
 * http://www.mail-archive.com/infinispan-dev@lists.jboss.org/msg05135.html
 *
 * Concretely, it borrows the idea of hashing the task and targeting it to a node based on that hash. The task distribution
 * paper uses a random number which is then mapped to a single node using the consistent view of members provided by
 * JGroups. In the interests of scalability, and since we have additional facilities provided by Infinispan, we'll use
 * something a little more complicated.
 *
 * The overall design is this:
 *
 * The ForkJoinPool is passed a cache instance on construction. We'll use that cache for two things: first, if tasks
 * want to operate on data that is within that cache, we will attempt to target the task to the cache node that contains
 * the cached data.  Second, we will use the associated consistent hashing and distribution configuration of that cache
 * to distribute tasks. More details on that later. This allows callers to configure exactly how we distribute tasks,
 * how many nodes in the cluster can fail, whether we are topology-aware, and so on, by using the standard cache
 * configuration mechanisms.
 *
 * We have a cluster of nodes, and each node can submit tasks to be executed by the cluster.
 * When submitting a task, we first check to see if the task has associated cache keys -- meaning, does this task expect
 * to operate on data that is within the cache. If so, we will generate a task ID that maps to the same partition as that
 * cache key. If it is not, we will generate a random taskId.
 *  -- TODO: make this behavior pluggable and rewrite this doc
 *
 * Given the task ID, we will use the consistent hashing function associated with the this consistent hash, we will then
 * find the owners of that hash (using the distribution configuration of the cache provided during construction) and
 * send the task to those owners (an EXECUTE message). The EXECUTE message includes the task to be executed and the list
 * of recipients.
 *
 * The recipients of an EXECUTE message add the message in their in-memory map of tasks in progress, along with the
 * submitter's address.
 *
 * Each of the nodes receiving the EXECUTE message checks to see if they are at the top of the list of recipients of
 * the message. If so, they execute the task and return the result to the submitter (a RESULT message).
 *
 * When the submitter receives the response, it broadcasts a REMOVE message to each of the original recipients (not the
 * current owners based on the consistent hash, because that could have changed). Those nodes then remove the message
 * from their map of tasks in progress.
 *
 * If a node X crashes (or leaves gracefully), every node looks to see whether it has any tasks owned by X in their map
 * of active tasks. If they exist, the node then looks to see if they are next on the list of recipients that was sent
 * with that message. If so, they become the new executor of that task.
 *
 * Why do we do it this way, instead of letting each node use their consistent hash to see if they are the current owner
 * of the partition?
 * Mainly because we cannot (I think?) guarantee that the list of owners hasn't changed since the message was sent. For
 * example:
 * What if the submitter hashes the task and sends it to (A,B,C), where A is the primary.  But D joins the cluster before
 * A gets the message, and D now ought to be primary. A, B, and C each receive the message, check and see that they are
 * not the owners, and just save the message away as "being executed by D".  However, D didn't even receive the message
 * -- they hadn't yet joined when the message was sent. We could work around that with vector clocks on messages and
 * node membership events to establish "happens-before", but just sending the list of who should execute seems simpler.
 *
 * All things being equal, I'd like to avoid sending the list of participants with the message, to save that few bytes.
 * How many?  Not many. But still...
 *
 * We could avoid this by always sending the message to *all* servers, and consistent hashing on receipt. But in that
 * case, when D joins the cluster before A gets the message, if D does not also get the message (because it had not yet
 * joined when the message was sent), then we still have problems.
 *
 * In the future, we could send two different messages:
 * EXECUTE_MASTER
 * EXECUTE_BACKUP
 * where EXECUTE_BACKUP has the list of recipients in it, but EXECUTE_MASTER doesn't. Save a few bytes for that one
 * message. But that additional complexity is not (yet) worth it for that few bytes for a single recipient.
 *
 * I'm still not a huge fan of push-based distribution; pull-based handles servers of different specs better. Not sure
 * if we can handle that at all.
 *
 * Could add a random assignment element with akka-like load reporting...
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * If a task is created and it is going to process data that is in the cache, then we'll use the same consistent hash
 * function that the cache is using. That way, the task should be executed on the same node that contains the cached
 * data. If a cache is distributed in such a way that multiple nodes contain the same data, we'll attempt to target the
 * one with the lowest load.
 *
 * If a task is created that isn't going to process data that is in the cache, things get more interesting. We use a
 * pluggable algorithm that attempts to find the node with the lowest load, giving a bit of extra weight to the local
 * node (since all things being equal, it is more efficient not to distribute at all).
 *
